# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Welcome to my first Python project! This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game where you can play against the computer. It's a fun way to practice your coding skills and have some entertainment at the same time. Give it a try and see if you can beat the computer!


This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game implemented in Python.
        
## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `rock_paper_scissors.py`.
2. Enter your choice when prompted (rock, paper, or scissors).
3. The computer will randomly select its choice.
4. The result of the game will be displayed.
